                <p align="justify"><span class="STYLE10">Counterfactual statements in essence deal with an alternate reality to the one that actually happened and usually talk about what happens as a result of being in this alternate scenario, like what should have happened or what could have happened had a certain event not occurred for example. Thus, a counterfactual statement includes an assumption that is <b>counter to the facts.</b> In other words, it means the assumption described in a specific sentence contradicts the <b>'facts'</b> that you know. The 'facts' include: </span></p>
                <ul class="STYLE10">
                    <li><b>Events that Have Already Happened</b></li>

                    <li><b>Common Sense</b></li>
                </ul>
                <p align="justify"><span class="STYLE10"> Whatever you think belongs to these categories of 'facts' can be used to determine whether a given statement is counterfactual.</span></p>

            <p align="justify"><span class="STYLE22">Following are some <b>*important*</b> and <b>useful</b> tips for this task:</span></p>
            <ol class="STYLE10">
                <li>A counterfactual sentence <b>must</b> include an assumption that is counter to the facts. Including a consequence of the assumption is optional, although consequences are very common. The assumption is the <b>*only*</b> way to figure out whether a statement is counterfactual. </li>
                <br>
                <li>A sentence that indicates a prediction about the future is <b><u>NOT</u></b> a counterfactual statement. This is because future events, even almost certain ones like the sun rising tomorrow, are not sure to happen and are <b>NOT</b> factual. <b>PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS CASE!</b> This will likely be one of the most common types of statement you will see and often times they will look like and have similar grammatical features to counterfactual statements. Just because <b>there is past or present tense in a statement does not mean it is not referring to future events</b>, be careful! </li>
                <br>
                <li>Our sentences are extracted from various sources and are provided without any context. So please focus on judging whether the statements are counterfactual or not instead of relying on sentential logic or probing sentence structures and grammar and judging based on that. <b>Use common sense and general knowledge with regards to assumptions, especially when dealing with present events, as this will help tremendously.</b></li>
                <br>
                <li>Remember that counterfactual is not lies or perceived lies so do not label statements you find as counterfactual just because you judge them to not be the truth. For example something like ¡°if X politician with Y political affiliation is to be elected, then they would increase taxes would go up 50%¡± is not counterfactual even if you think it is not true.</li>
                <br>
                <li> We know that some statements will be difficult to judge, but just follow the definition and give your best guess.</li>

                <li><u>They are discussing what our clothes would say <b>if they could talk.</b></u><p>(We all know that the clothes can¡¯t speak, the assumption contradicts <b>Common Sense.</b>)</p></li>
                <li><u>Would the prisoner be alive <b>if rifleman A had not shot</b>?</u><p>(It¡¯s a counterfactual question. It can be inferred that rifleman A had shot, and as a result the question is asking what would happen if rifleman A had not shot. Thus, it is an assumption that contradicts <b>Events that Have Already Happened.</b>)</p></li>
                <li><u><b>Had the researchers tested their "vitamin mix" in pill form or mixed with water</b>, "that would be different it might have shown that blood sugar got better," says Buse.</u><p>(In fact, the researchers haven¡¯t tested their pills and if they test the pills, the results will be different.
