# SemEval2020_Task5
This is the repository for SemEval 2020 Task 5 Counterfactual Detection. The related paper is `SemEval-2020 Task 5 Counterfactual Recognition.pdf`. Also, my report `ELEC896 report.pdf` for Master thesis can be a detail reference for this task. 

We collected counterfactual sentences online from three domains, finance, politics and health and then labeled them on the crowdsource platform, Amazon Turk. After that, we processed the results to build our dataset. Data and baseline model for Subtask 1 and Subtask 2 can be found in the folds `Subtask1_data` and `Subtask2_data`. 
## Data collection and parsing ##

## Turk UI ##
The workers' UI can be seen in `Work UI.html`. Before we got the workers into the tasks, we gave them a tutorial for the each task and then made sure that they were all clear on what we wanted. Tutorial can be found in `Subtask1 UI.html` and `Subtask2 UI.html` respectively. Actually, we planned to established a third task, but due to the problem of short of time, it had been merged into Subtask 2, but you can still find `Subtask3 UI.html`. 
## Results processing ##
coming soon
