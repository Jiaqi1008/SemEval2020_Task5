# SemEval2020_Task5
This is the repository for SemEval 2020 Task 5 Counterfactual Detection. The related paper is `SemEval-2020 Task 5 Counterfactual Recognition.pdf`. Also, my report `ELEC896 report.pdf` for Master thesis can be a detail reference for this task. 

We collected counterfactual sentences online from three domains, finance, politics and health and then labeled them on the crowdsource platform, Amazon Turk. After that, we processed the results to build our dataset. Data and baseline model for Subtask 1 and Subtask 2 can be found in the folds `Subtask1_data` and `Subtask2_data`.
